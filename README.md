# BLDC motor control
The goal of the project is to model and simulate the electric motor and controller for a power window of an automobile. We have carried out the activity using the model-based approach. We verified the plant using a test vector to the MIL and then code generation was done for the plant using embedded coder . The Plant model was verified using MIL and SIL.
